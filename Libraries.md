### Notes on Altium Libraries

## PCB footprints
* For SMD pads, ensure top layer is chosen
* Place 3D object on mech layer 1

### Layers

**Top Overlay / Silkscreen**
 - Polarity dot/diode symbol/cap + (any text should be smallest 1mm and width 0.153mm, for jlc)
 - line to stop bridging between close pads

**Mechanical 15**
- Assembly outline and center "+" (for pick and place)
- Goes around total outline, width 0.05mm
